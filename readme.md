## About

This library contains utility functions I use every day in Node.js and frontend JS development.

I made it for myself, but you're welcome to use it for your projects. It has zero dependencies (except Jest as a dev dependency).

### Tests

You can run tests with `npm test`. I use Facebook's Jest for writing/running tests.
It's included as a dev dependency, so make sure you have those installed.
